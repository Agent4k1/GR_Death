-- Server-side logic for player deaths
-- In this example, the server script is minimal but can be expanded as needed

-- Function to handle custom death logic (e.g., logging deaths)
RegisterServerEvent('playerDied')
AddEventHandler('playerDied', function(playerId)
    local playerName = GetPlayerName(playerId)
    print(string.format("Player %s has died.", playerName))
end)

-- Optional: Add functionality to log death events or manage player states
